# Design-and-development-of-hybrid-Optimization-enabled-Deep-Q-learning-model-for-Covid-19-detection-
The problem of respiratory sound classification has received good attention from the clinical scientists and medical researcherâ€™s community in the last year to the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. In this paper, the input audio samples are fed into the pre-processing module in which median filtering is done to remove the noise and artifacts from the audio samples. The feature extraction is carried out by considering features, like spectral contrast, Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) algorithm, spectral flux, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), spectral roll-off, spectral centroid, Root mean square energy, zero-crossing rate, spectral bandwidth, spectral flatness, power spectral density, mobility complexity, fluctuation index and relative amplitude. Moreover, the deep Q network is applied for Covid-19 classification phase wherein the training of deep Q network is done using the proposed optimization algorithm, named Snake Jaya Honey Badger Optimization (SJHBO) algorithm. The proposed SJHBO algorithm is the hybridization of Jaya Honey Badger Optimization (JHBO) along with Snake optimization. Hence, the developed method achieved the better superior performance based on the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity .
